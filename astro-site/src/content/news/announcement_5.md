Nathan's thesis was examined by 
[Dr Chris Lamb](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/christopherlamb.html),
[Dr Ailith Ewing](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-ailith-ewing), and 
[Dr Brian Tom](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/t-to-z/brian-tom/). 

Nathan was jointly supervised by Dr Catalina Vallejos and Dr Karla Monterrubio
in the Vallejos group and by [Professor Charlie Lees](https://charlielees.com/).
Nathan's work focused on exploring heterogeneity in characterising heterogeneity in IBD by clustering
subjects based upon longitudinal biomarker profiles (faecal calprotectin and
CRP).

Nathan is now continuing to work in the Vallejos and Lees groups as a
postdoctoral research associate, continuing his ongoing research.
