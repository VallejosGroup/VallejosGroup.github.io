After giving the customary IGC pre-viva seminar, Alan's thesis was examined by
[Christopher Yau](https://cwcyau.github.io),
[Davide Risso](http://drisso.github.io), and
[Tamir Chandra](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/research/chandra-group). 

Alan's thesis introduced and explored methods of increasing speed and
scalability for Bayesian RNAseq analysis. In addition to his research, Alan is
well-known at the IGC thanks to his involvement in the institute's social life
and teaching: being a reliable fountain of programming knowledge. 

We all wish you the best for your new job at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Dr 
O'Callaghan!
