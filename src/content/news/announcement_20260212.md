Congratulations to Dr Linda Nguyen for successfully passing her viva! 

Linda's PhD project focused on the study of the mechanisms underlying 
photoreceptor death in retinis pigmentosa. Her thesis was examined by 
[Mike Cheetam (UCL)](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/10905-mike-cheetham/grants) and
[Shipra Bhatia](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/shipra-bhatia/).

Throughout her studies, Linda combined wet-lab and computational approaches, 
including the generation and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing datasets. 
She also completed a 9-months internship at Roche, Switzerland. 

Linda was co-supervised by 
[Roly Megaw](https://institute-genetics-cancer.ed.ac.uk/research/research-groups-a-z/megaw-group) and 
[Pleasantine Mill](https://institute-genetics-cancer.ed.ac.uk/research/research-groups-a-z/mill-group).
