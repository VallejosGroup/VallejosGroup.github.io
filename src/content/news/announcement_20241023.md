We are excited to announce that our paper describing SPARRAv4 has been published 
in [npj Digital Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01250-1). 

SPARRA (Scottish Patients At Risk of Readmission and Admission) is a risk 
prediction model which was originally developed by Public Health Scotland to
identify individuals at a high risk of requiring urgent hospital care. Our 
team developed the latest version of the model, SPARRAv4. Read more about it 
in the press release [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2024/ai-tool-predicts-emergency-hospital-risk). 

This project is the outcome of a long term collaboration with 
[Public Health Scotland](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/), supported by
[Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk) and 
[The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk). The project is co-led
by Dr Catalina Vallejos and [Prof Louis Aslett](https://www.louisaslett.com).
