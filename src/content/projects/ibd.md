# Background

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a complex, chronic condition characterised
by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. Identifying which patients
are at high risk for disease flares or severe complications is a major clinical
challenge. 

Our group is developing enhanced patient stratification methods to support
precision medicine in IBD. By leveraging longitudinal data and advanced
statistical modelling, we aim to provide clinicians with dynamic risk prediction
tools that can adapt as a patient's clinical profile changes over time.

This work represents a long-standing collaboration with

# Longitudinal Biomarkers and the Lothian IBD Registry

A core foundation of our research relies on integrating routinely collected
real-world data to build robust, scalable stratification models. By utilising
the **Lothian IBD Registry**, describing nearly all IBD patients
receiving secondary care from NHS Lothian, we incorporate deeply phenotyped
Electronic Health Records (EHR) into our predictive frameworks. 

By analysing repeated biomarker measurements, our statistical models can
capture the dynamic nature of the disease. This moves our predictive
capabilities beyond baseline-only assessments, offering a continuously updated
view of a patient's risk profile as their disease progresses.

#  The PREdiCCt Cohort

While local EHRs provide a macro-level view of patient pathways, we also
investigate the granular trajectory of IBD through highly phenotyped datasets.
We work extensively with data from the
[**PREdiCCt** study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwbcF4B7-tY), a major
prospective cohort designed to investigate how environmental factors, diet, the
gut microbiome, and biomarkers influence IBD outcomes.

# Dynamic Risk Prediction via Survival Analysis

To translate longitudinal data into actionable clinical insights, we employ
survival analysis techniques, specifically focusing on landmarking. This
approach allows us to update survival and risk predictions as new clinical
information becomes available, providing a real-time assessment of the risk of
disease flare or the need for therapy escalation.

To facilitate these analyses, our team actively develops open-source software,
