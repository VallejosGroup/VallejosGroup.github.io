    <h1>About us</h1>

    <div class="content">
    
      <p>
      The Biomedical Data Science research group uses a cross-disciplinary 
      approach working at the interface between statistics, machine learning, 
      and biomedicine. The group is led by Dr Catalina Vallejos, based at The 
      University of Edinburgh, as part of the Epidemiology and Clinical Trials
      Theme witin the Institute of Genetics and Cancer.

    <h1>What we do</h1>
      
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Our research focuses on developing robust computational methods and 
        open‑source software that address key challenges in biomedicine. We work 
        closely with a wide range of domain experts to address questions in aging, 
        disease mechanisms, and population‑scale health. Guided by substantial 
        real-world applications, we design and and apply novel methodology, 
        whilst developing open-source software tools to facilitate broarer 
        adoption and enhance scientific reproducibilty. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work spans different types of biomedical data, from molecular 
        (single cell sequencing, DNA methylation) to clinical (electronic health 
        records). Key research areas include:
      </p> 
      
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"> 
        <li>
          <strong>Survival analysis methodology:</strong>
          including approaches to incorporate unobserved heterogeneity, 
          competing risks and metrics to quantify predictive performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic risk prediction:</strong>
          focusing on landmarking as a flexible and scalable approach to 
          dynamically predict event risk based on longitudinal measurements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clinical prediction models:</strong>
          to identify individuals at a high risk of adverse events with 
          applications in the context of emergency hospital admissions, 
          inflammatory bowel disease and chronic kidney disease, among others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bayesian hierarchical models:</strong>
          to quantify multiple sources of technical and biological variability
          arising in single cell sequencing assays.
        </li>
